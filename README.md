This repository contains two simple machine-learning projects:

## Project 1: Predicting House Prices

A linear regression model to predict house prices based on features such as location, size, and number of rooms.

### Technical tools:
- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

### Usage:
1. Ensure `house_prices.csv` is in the `house_prices` folder.
2. Run `house_prices.py` to train and evaluate the model's performance.

## Project 2: Predicting Customer Churn

A logistic regression model to predict customer churn based on customer data.

### Technical tools:
- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

### Usage:
1. Ensure `customer_churn.csv` is in the `customer_churn` folder.
2. Run `customer_churn.py` to train the model and evaluate its performance.
